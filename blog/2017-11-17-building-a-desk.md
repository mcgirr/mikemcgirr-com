The table top starts out as maple wood boards that are then cut into strips of 
equal width.  This may seem a bit counter-intuitive since we want the height of
all the sections to be the same and we don't care about the width.
However - eventually the pieces will be rotated so that what was *once* the width
of a section will be it's future **thickness**.  Doing it this way is nice since we
don't have to be stuck with what the original mill set the height to be. 

Once all the sections have the same height (which was the reason for cutting the
boards into strips of the same width initially.) we can arrange them and glue 
them together with a strong wood glue.  The wood glue is strong enough that the
wood will give before the glue does so we are effectively left with a single
piece of wood for our table top. This method also give us a cheap way to decide
on how thick we want the table top to be and what size - a piece of wood that
started out this size could be quite expensive or impossible to find.

Here is one section of the top after the rough sections have finished being glued
together:

This is the finish I used for this desk.

![One of the legs after being tacked together.](/images/table/IMG_2381.JPG)
This is one so the legs in the process of being welded together. We first did
tack welds on each of the corners followed by the main welds.

<!-- Order from onlinemetals.com -->
I ordered the steel for the legs from 
[online metals](http://www.onlinemetals.com/ "Online Metals")
I opted for hot rolled rectangle tubes sized 1" x 3" x 0.12"
and cut to: 96". We later further cut these down to the sizes used in the table.
The steel I specifically used was `Mild Steel A513` and the 2 pieces cost
$61.91/piece.

Of course being mild steel this meant that it was subject to rust so the next step 
after welding was to have the two steel legs of the table powder coated.

The table top itself sits on top of a large sheet of plywood that connects the
two legs. The table top is secured in position with large dowels drilled into 
the table top.

The wheels are fixed with bolts (and screws in some cases) through holes we 
drilled in the steel frame once it was powder coated.  
The wheels are the `3-5/32" Hollow Wheel, Met. Alu. w/ Brake & Plate` from 
[Doug Mockett & Company](https://www.mockett.com/ "https://www.mockett.com/")
and cost $46.60 total.

All done! 

Happy coding :-)
