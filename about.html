    <p>
        Master of Science in Computer Science from Oregon State University with the
        <a href="https://github.com/lambda-land">Programming Languages research group</a>
        (March 2018).
    </p>

    <p>
        I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from the University of
        Oregon in 2015.
    </p>

    <p>
        My research focuses on Domain Specific Languages and functional programming
        languages. I particularly enjoy <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
        and <a href="http://www.purescript.org/">Purescript</a> as well as the
        <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> programming language.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is supplemented by a general interest in Linux and all things open source.
