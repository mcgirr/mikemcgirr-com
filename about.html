<p>
    I'm a M.S. candidate in Computer Science at Oregon State University with the
    Programming Languages group.
</p>

<p>
    I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from the University of
    Oregon in 2015.
</p>

<p>
    My research focuses on Domain Specific Languages and functional programming
    languages. I particularly enjoy <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
    and <a href="http://www.purescript.org/">Purescript</a> as well as the
    <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> programming language.
</p>

<p>
    This is supplemented by a general interest in Linux and all things open source.

<p>
    Also I really do not like the Go programming language. I highly recommend reading:
